[Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error)


# Required Documents For Submission

## Group submission:

PPT describing the analysis
Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the analysis with both code and results
Prediction results in the format of house id and sale price (see sample_submission.csv for formatting)
For each team, please submit one folder with all the documents above, each one named after your team name.

## Individual Submission:

Each individual student please submit your scores for your peers in your team individually on your own.
Please include your team members' names and your scores in excel or txt format. 
To get the peer score for yourself, you need to submit your scorings on your peers.

# Grading

**70% from MAPE**

> Your team's grade will be proportional to the best performer in your class, based on the evaluation metric, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
> For instance, if the best team scored 1% MAPE, while team A achieve 3% MAPE, then team A's project grade will be
> (1 - 0.03) / (1 - 0.01) * 100 = 97.98

**20% from presentation skills.**

**10% from the average peer score from your team members.**
